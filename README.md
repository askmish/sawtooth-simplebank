# sawtooth-simplewallet
A simple sawtooth "simplewallet" transaction family example (processor + client)

# Introduction

This is a minimal example of a sawtooth 1.0 application. This example demonstrates, a common usecase, where a customer deposits/withdraws/transfers money from a wallet account.

A customer can:
1. deposit money into his/her wallet account
2. withdraw money from his/her wallet account
3. check the balance in the wallet account
4. transfer money from his/her wallet account to another

The customer is identified by a customer name and a corresponding public key. The wallet account balance, is stored at an address, derived from SHA 512 hash of customer's public key and the simplewallet transaction family namespace.

# Components
The application is built in two parts:
1. The client application written in Python, written in two parts: _client.py file representing the backend stuff and the _cli.py representing the frontend stuff. The example is built by using the setup.py file located in one directory level up.

2. The Transaction Processor is written in C++11 using c++-sawtooth-sdk. It comes with its CMake files for build. The Transaction Processor is also available in Java and Python.

**NOTE**

The client is also written in Javascript using node.js. The `app.js` is the main javascript file from where the `main` function call occurs. Handlebars are used for templating, client related CSS and JavaScript code is written in public folder and server related files are written in router/ folder. Running the default docker-compose.yaml file launches the client, which is accessible at `localhost:3000`.

# Pre-requisites

This example uses docker-compose and Docker containers. If you do not have these installed please follow the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/install/

**NOTE:**
The preferred OS environment is Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS x64. Although, other linux distributions which support Docker should work. 
If you have Windows please install [Docker Toolbox for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) or [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), based on your OS version.

**NOTE:**
The minimum version of Docker Engine necessary is 17.03.0-ce. Linux distributions often ship with older versions of Docker.

[Here's a gist](https://gist.github.com/askmish/76e348e34d93fc22926d7d9379a0fd08) detailing steps on installing docker and docker-compose.

### Working with proxies

**For linux:**

Follow the instructions in [sawtooth-core/BUILD.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/BUILD.md#step-two-configure-proxy-optional)

**For pre-Windows 10 versions** (using Docker Toolbox for Windows):

Start the virtualbox host with:
```
   docker-machine rm default
   docker-machine create -d virtualbox --engine-env HTTP_PROXY=<your_http_proxy> --engine-env HTTPS_PROXY=<your_https_proxy> --engine-env NO_PROXY=<your_no_proxy> default
```   
When you start Kitematic it will initially show an error, but just click "Use Virtualbox". 

**For Windows 10** (using Docker for Windows):

Right click on the Docker icon in the notification area, select Settings. Then click Proxies. Select "Manual proxy configuration" and enter the following then click Apply.
```
    Web Server (HTTP):         <your_http_proxy>
    Secure Web Server (HTTPS): <your_https_proxy>
    Bypass for these hosts:    <your_no_proxy>,localhost,127.0.0.1
```

# Usage

Start the pre-built Docker containers in docker-compose.yaml file, located in sawtooth-simplewallet directory:
```bash
cd sawtooth-simplewallet
docker-compose up
```
At this point all the containers should be running.

To launch the client, you could do this:
```bash
docker exec -it simplewallet-client bash
```

You can locate the right Docker client container name using `docker ps`.

Sample command usage:

```bash
#Create a wallet
sawtooth keygen jack #This creates the public/private keys for Jack, a pre-requisite for the following commands

simplewallet deposit 100 jack #This adds 100 units to Jack's account

simplewallet withdraw 50 jack #Withdraws 50 units from Jack's account

simplewallet balance jack #Displays the balance left in Jack's account

#Create 2nd wallet
sawtooth keygen jill #This creates the public/private keys for Jill, a pre-requisite for the following commands

simplewallet deposit 100 jill #This adds 100 units to Jill's account

simplewallet balance jill #Displays the balance left in Jill's account

simplewallet transfer 25 jack jill #Transfer 25 units money from Jack to Jill

simplewallet balance jack #Displays the balance left in Jack's account

simplewallet balance jill #Displays the balance left in Jill's account

```

# Building containers
To build TP code of your preferred language and run the simplewallet example:

```bash
docker-compose -f simplewallet-build-tp-<your_prog_language>.yaml up --build
```
where,
 <your_prog_language> should be replaced with either `cxx`, `java`, or `py`
